# Fake Task Detection
This project aims to use GAN to create fake tasks and verify fake task detection performance.<br>
Fake task attack is critical for Mobile Crowdsensing system (MCS) that aim to clog the sensing servers in
the MCS platform and drain more energy from participantsâ€™ smart devices. Typically, fake tasks are
created by empirical model such as CrowdSenSim tool. Recently, cyber criminals deploy more intelligent
mechanisms to create attacks. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is one of the most powerful
techniques to generate synthetic samples. GAN considers the entire data in the training dataset to
create similar samples. This project aims to use GAN to create fake tasks and verify fake task detection
performance.
