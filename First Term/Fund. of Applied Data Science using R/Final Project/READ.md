Cancer is a terrible heterogeneous illness that refers to the abnormal proliferation of cell tissue. As a result, precisely recognizing the presence of cancer cells becomes critical. Given the number of individuals affected by cancer, we need to develop better methods of detection and treatment. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning algorithms, is a hot study topic in medical science. It is capable of making conclusive interpretations of "big"-sized complicated data and so looks to be the most effective instrument for the analysis and comprehension of multi-omics data for patient-specific observations. Many of these techniques, including Decision Trees (DTs), Neural Networks (NN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), have been widely used in cancer diagnosis. This paper uses gene expression data to identify liver cancer biomarkers to aid in early detection and disease prognosis monitoring.
